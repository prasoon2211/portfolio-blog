Summary: Things you should know about me.

Hi. I am Prasoon, a Maths undergrad and a programmer. I enjoy metal (heavy, doom and thrash), classic rock, Indian and Western classical music. Led Zeppelin is my favourite band though Opeth comes a close second. I have tees for both.

Programming occupies the greater part of my free time but I also indulge quite a bit in reading. Other than that, I play the flute (the bansuri, not to be confused with Western concert flutes) when I feel like it.

I enjoy volleyball. I broke my ankle once playing it. But I'm fine now.

Drop me message if you wish. I'll be glad to talk to you!
